To use this to do your homework

Two targets are provided Debug and Release. Debug is the debug version of the program
and Release is the release version.

When you are ready to compile your program hit the Build Button or choose it from the menu Build > Build (Ctrl + F9)
And to run it hit the Run Button or choose it from the menu (Ctrl + F10)
or you may select Build + Run (F9)

If you get problems when Code::Blocks is trying to link your program (something about g++)
then sudo apt-get install g++ within a terminal.

To run gdb under the Debug menu select start (F8) you may set breakpoints within the IDE
and the IDE will tell you if a segmentation fault occurs.
You can also graphically step through your program.


Note the project is already set up to compile under our flags 
And you must still turn in the makefile when you submit this assignment
(and please do test your program under the makefile before you submit)!

For more info email Brandon and I will be happy to answer your questions.
